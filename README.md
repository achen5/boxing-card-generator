## Challenges

**Should I convert my app's state into nested objects?**

I decided not to. Reading the app's state may be easier if it was organized into objects. However, updating a property would require rerendering the property's object, instead of just the property. This could cause performance issues if the app were to expand in scope.

**How to I ensure that the user inputs the correct data type i.e. the user inputs a number in a number input and not a string?**

`<input>` elements in HTML5 allow developers to set a type. `<input type="number">` prevents the user from inputting the string.
