# Boxing Trading Card Generator

Live demo: [https://achen5.github.io/boxing-card-generator/](https://achen5.github.io/boxing-card-generator/)

This React web app allows users to generate trading cards of their favorite boxers. This app utilizes the Promise API and html2canvas library so users can download their cards.

This app was created for Discord's boxing community, a community of over 60,000 members. It is regularly updated based on community feedback. The generated trading card's assets and design are based on Pokemon trading cards.

## In development
- Make the web app responsive. The app is not optimized for mobile yet.
- A button that auto generates cards for popular boxers. The data will likely be fetched from [https://boxrec.com/](https://boxrec.com/).
- A bulleted list which gives users tips on building a great card. That list would be below the menu.
- CSS Animations for a smoother user experience.
